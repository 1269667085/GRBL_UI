# GRBL_UI in C# for EleksDraw plotter
A small application to send G-Code to the EleksDraw COREXY plotter.  
Written in C# and compiled with the Visual Studio Community Edition 2017.
  
This work employs a relatively small contribution from me :) I "glued-together" several bits and pieces from repos around the web. The following works were used to create this application:  
  
  Otto Hermansson, GcodeSender : https://github.com/OttoHermansson/GcodeSender  
  Flicker Free List Box : http://yacsharpblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/listbox-flicker.html  
  Chris Yerga, SVG Support (Experimental) : https://github.com/yergacheffe/lasercam  
  David Suarez, 3d GCode Viewer : https://github.com/dsuarezv/Netduino-gcode  
  
The EleksCAM software that comes with the device is OK, but even the latest version seems to crash a lot. I tried a bunch of GCode 'sending' software, but the version by Otto Hermansson proved to be the simple and reliable.  

Thanks also to Atomic Shrimp (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSXXLTdh9FY) for putting up the unboxing movies, and Zax (http://forum.eleksmaker.com/user/zax) on the EleksMaker forum for filling in some of the blanks.
